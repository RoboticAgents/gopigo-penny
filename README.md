# Penny's Ice Cream

Robot designed to draw pictures!

## Community Demonstrations

We pre-programed functions that make the robot draw different shapes, such as triangles and circles. We will have the kids create a main function that combines these functions and then have them call the robot to execute the code, helping them to understand the basics of programming. Once they are able to get the robot to draw the ice cream, they can then color their ice cream in. We will also be displaying the trial and error drawings the robot created, helping the kids to understand that no matter your skill level, you still will have to work hard in order to get the program to do exactly what you want it to. We want the kids to learn some programming and about the importance of hard work while having fun and being creative.
