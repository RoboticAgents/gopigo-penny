## Participation in Races

### Describe the specific decisions you made in your implementation. Also, describe the ethical or aggressive behavior of your robot for each race.
We decided to set the motors to 98% because through trial and error we discovered that was the maximum speed the motors would be able to run at. We also decided to put a wooden long piece at the front to stabilize the box for the push race. Our robots behavior is ethical because it is programed to just go in a straight line and leave the other robots alone. 

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations

### Idea

Our Idea for the second part of our first project is to create a robot that draws pictures! 

### Requested Components

We would attach a pen or marker to the robot and then it would drag it so that the pen drags along the paper as the robot moves. We would get it to draw the top of an icecream cone and then the kids can color it in!

### Schedule

TODO: Timeline | Tasks --------                | ------ dates             | tasks
               | Mechanical Additions Complete | September 15th           | task 1
               | Coding Complete for Circle    | September 22nd by 2:30pm | task 2
               | 

## Robot for Community Demonstrations

The basic idea is that we would pre-program the robot to draw certain shapes (like a circle) and then have the kids call the command that makes the robot execute the certain shapes.
They would be actually getting the robot to move without doing any of the super complex coding.
