## Participation in Races

We decided to set the motors to 98% because through trial and error we discovered that was the maximum speed the motors would be able to run at. We also decided to put a wooden long piece at the front to stabilize the box for the push race. Our robots behavior is ethical because it is programed to just go in a straight line and leave the other robots alone.

## Planning for Robot Design for Community Demonstrations

### Idea

Our Idea for the second part of our first project is to create a robot that draws pictures!

### Requested Components

We would attach a pen or marker to the robot and then it would drag it so that the pen drags along the paper as the robot moves. We would get it to draw the top of an ice cream cone and then the kids can color it in!

## Robot for Community Demonstrations

We pre-programed functions that make the robot draw different shapes, such as triangles and circles. We will have the kids create a main function that combines these functions and then have them call the robot to execute the code, helping them to understand the basics of programming. Once they are able to get the robot to draw the ice cream, they can then color their ice cream in. We will also be displaying the trial and error drawings the robot created, helping the kids to understand that no matter your skill level, you still will have to work hard in order to get the program to do exactly what you want it to. We want the kids to learn some programming and about the importance of hard work while having fun and being creative.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

During this project we actually struggled with some of our hardware. At first everything seemed to be working smoothly but then our right motor stopped working. This resulted in the right wheel not spinning. At first we just thought that the wheel was broken or that the washer wasn't doing it's job properly, but after testing these things, we came to the conclusion that it was in fact the motor breaking. We took a different motor from one of the robots that was not being used and replaced the broken motor with a working one. This fixed our issue with the motor, but we were still struggling with a battery that didn't seem to work as well as it should. We also replaced that piece of the robot and now Penny seems to be running smoothly!
Our group struggled with hardware for the most part during the community section of our assignment. We struggled with the wheels, because they would sometimes stop turning when the robot was told to turn. We think this was due to bad motors and potentially friction against the washers. We also struggled with the specifics of the weight in terms of where the battery was placed on the robot. We started out with the battery on top of the robot, but after a while we realized that it was weighing the robot down and made sharp turns very difficult. We decided to move the battery back to the back end of the robot which ended up helping a lot. We also struggled with inconsistency in general. Because the hardware wasn't always working in a predictable way, we were often struggling to set the parameters for the project that would produce the output drawing that we were interested in. We wanted to have the robot draw an ice cream cone, but this didn't always work because the angles would change when the hardware changed. We ended up finding out that sometimes shutting off the robot and giving it a minute worked the best to help reset the hardware.

## Team Work

We all worked extremely well as a team. From the very start we all put together our GoPiGo. We took turns doing each task for building the robot such as with the using the screwdriver for tightening and assembly. When we had to replace the motor Katie and Pallas worked on the hardware while Evelyn was on the computer running the test code. For every step we were on the same page and working together. We all took turns coding and helped check each other's code as we went along. We met outside of class multiple times and everyone showed up each time. Even when there wasn't opportunities for us all to be working on the same thing people still were busy. For example, when Katie and Evelyn were working on fixing the marker rig, Pallas made an artistic representation of the drawing on Adobe Illustrator to be used later as a visual aid when presenting to the larger audience. Katie often times brought the materials such as the paper and markers down from the resource room for the project while Evelyn and Pallas often volunteered their laptops for either programing or using outside resources or the lab. We all took turns catching the bot and handling the hardware and working with the software coding throughout the trial and error process. Overall, the team worked extremely well together and we are satisfied with the results.
